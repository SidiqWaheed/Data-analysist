### Exploratory Data Analysis 

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- Which product are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with 

```sql
SELECT *FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a
few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
